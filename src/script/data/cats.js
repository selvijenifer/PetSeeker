    description: 'Siamese cats are very sensitive to the temperature around them and are not suited to cold climates because of their short coat. Although they prefer a warm environment, this very beautiful breed also does not really like climates that are too hot. The Siamese cat is one of the oldest recorded cat breeds.

    description: 'Short-haired Persian cats, whose origins are desert cats, have a coat that is 2 times thicker to protect them from the harsh desert environment. Its also what makes them survive in colder climates. Although sand cats originally from the desert have a tolerance for warmer climates, long-haired Persians have higher body temperatures and Persian kittens can be affected by hot, humid weather and are prone to heat stroke and extreme heat.',

    description: 'Snowshoe is a new addition to the cat family. A kitten with four white legs was found in a thoroughbred Siamese kitten, from where the Snowshoe we know today began. The body shape is quite like Asian or foreign cats, following the appearance of the Siamese of the past. The only extreme in this cat are the eyes, they should be walnut-shaped (bigger and rounder than the Siamese cats eyes, but not as round as the Persians), also as bright and blue as possible.',

What sets the sphinx cat apart from almost all other cat breeds is its striking appearance, characterized by hairless, wrinkled skin and larger-than-usual ears. Most sphinx cats have slender bodies, but some of them are not only slim, they are also muscular and pot-bellied. In addition to its slender figure, the sphinx cat has a triangular face with prominent cheekbones and wide eyes. The unusual appearance of the sphinx cat, as well as its name, often reminds us of cats from ancient Egypt.',

The Siberian is a large, strong cat that takes up to 5 years to mature. They are known for their agility and muscular strength which gives them the uncanny ability to jump long distances. Its long coat is arguably its best quality and a range of colors including tabby, solid and fawn. Siberians are intelligent and loyal animals who love to greet their owners at the door when they come home.',
